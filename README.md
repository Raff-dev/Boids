Boids is an artificial life simulation, which aims to replicate behaviour of flocks of birds.
---
Individual boids follow three fundamental rules:   
   * cohesion
   * alignment
   * separation   
### They are able to group up, align themself against other ones, stay away from each other by a specified distance, and avoid any obstacles.
